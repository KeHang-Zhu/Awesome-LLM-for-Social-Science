This repo aims to track research works the emergent displine of using LLM agent as human subject in social science

We strongly encourage the researchers that want to promote their fantastic work to the LLM social science to make pull request to update their paper's information!

## Experiment

**Large language models as simulated economic agents: What can we learn from homo silicus?** \
*John Horton* \

April 2023\
TL;DR: This paper show generally possible to run these experiments and get interesting variation in the answers

PMLR, 2023. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10264)]\
9 Jul 2023\
TL;DR: This paper show generally possible to run these experiments and get interesting variation in the answers


**Out of One, Many: Using Language Models to Simulate Human Samples** \
*Lisa P. Argyle, E. Busby, Nancy Fulda, Joshua Ronald Gubler, Christopher Michael Rytting, David Wingate*  \ 
Political Analysis, 2023. [[Paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/abs/out-of-one-many-using-language-models-to-simulate-human-samples/035D7C8A55B237942FB6DBAD7CAA4E49)] \
21 Feb 2023\
TL;DR: First validation on some set of new humans, shows that perceptions of political associations are similar for LLMs and people

Harvard Business School Working Paper, 2023 [[Paper](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/23-062_b8fbedcd-ade4-49d6-8bb7-d216650ff3bd.pdf)] \
30 Mar 2023 \
TL;DR: Shows usefulness as an economic tool, derive empirical demand curves that are not perfect in a human way

**CogBench: a large language model walks into a psychology lab** \
*Julian Coda-Forno, Marcel Binz, Jane X. Wang, Eric Schulz* \
arxiv, 2024. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18225)]\
28 Feb 2024\
TL;DR: Fine-tune an LLM on specific decisions from two experiments and accurately predict the results out of sample on a third experiment

**Frontiers: Determining the Validity of Large Language Models for Automated Perceptual Analysis** \
*Peiyao Li, Noah Castelo, Zsolt Katona , Miklos Sarvary* \
Market Science, 2024. [[Paper](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mksc.2023.0454)]\
25 Jan 2024 \
TL;DR: Elicit preference over a variety car brands, find that out of sample human preferences are matched very accurately

** 
*Burns et al, *\
2023; 

TL;DR: LLMs encode latent social information in their networks, authors discover a subspace that is matched with things being “true” or “false” 

Gurnee and Tegmark, 
2023; 
TL;DR: LLMs have some sort of world model of time and space in their layers
