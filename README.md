Li et al., 2024; 
elicit preference over a variety car brands, find that out of sample human preferences are matched very accurately

** 
*Burns et al, *\
2023; 

LLMs encode latent social information in their networks, authors discover a subspace that is matched with things being “true” or “false” 

Gurnee and Tegmark, 2023; LLMs have some sort of world model of time and space in their layers
